// this is how the redux state could look like, just after the data has been imported from the backend.
// the checkboxes object has been filtered by a backend middleware,
// to sort out for examples those names whose grade doesn't meet the class requirement.

// NB if admin changes the price of item, then will not know how much user has paid, if was before or after the change.
// Will only know that is has been successfully registered to the class -> OK
// then will need to check date of paiement, date of price change, Stripe paiement records...

// export to backend will contain users, eventId, timeStamp (calculated at time of export)

// in one go the paiement and the update to the profile are done. No need of an updated profile if you pay nothing!!
